What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A hidden .git folder is created in the main working directory. This file is used to store all the meta data in this folder and the subdirectories of the main working directory. You may also specify which files and folders to track and store meta data on.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	The staging area is a list of files you want to commit to the repository. The working directory contains all the files related to the project. The staging area lets you pick which files you want part of the commit. This lets you add a quick description related to the files you are about to commit to the repository.



Commands:

ls -a | lists all files and folders including the invisable ones
git init | create the .git folder that contains all the meta data
git status | shows which files have changed since the last commit
git add [file] | adds a file to the staging area before a commit is made
git reset [file] | removes the file from the staging area
