When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	Having a remote repository makes it easier to share code. Also you don't have to worry about losing your work since it is saved on a remote computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Pulling changes manually allows you to finish what you're working on before the changes other people may have made gets added to the project. This helps eliminate code with bugs.
